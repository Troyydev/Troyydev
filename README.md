## 🚀 What I Do

- 🎮 **[Johns Learning](https://johns-learning.co.uk)**  
  A surreal, horror-education VR game for Meta Quest 2/3. Built in Unity with custom AI logic, baked lighting, and performance-focused design.

- 🧩 **[PlayFab-Pal](https://troyy.playfab-pal.co.uk)**  
  A powerful PlayFab toolkit for devs — inventory editing, banning, cloud script testing, and live player insights. Built with Flask + PlayFab APIs.

- 🧠 **LLM Projects (NeuraAssist)**  
  Desktop AI assistant powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com), using LLaMA models like MythoMax. Runs locally with GPU control, clipboard, browser, and VS integration.

- 🔐 **Custom Backends**  
  Flask-based multiplayer and XP APIs with token-secured endpoints, promo code systems, room management, admin control, and threaded cloud backups.

- 🕵️ **Reverse Engineering & Hacking Hardware**  
  I reverse engineer routers (AJAX APIs, Telnet shells), build Wi-Fi tools like **LANLink-47**, and use ESP32 boards for deauthing, handshake capture, and IoT automation.
